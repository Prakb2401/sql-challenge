### SQL-Challenge

## General Information
In this challenge I used SQL and PostgreSQL to conduct Data modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis on several csv that contain employee information. I Started creating ERD diagram of all my tables, establishing primary and foreign keys, and establishing data types. Then I created all the tables in my SQL database and imported the correct csv dat to each table. Finally I used the created tables to run analysis and answer question about the data.
